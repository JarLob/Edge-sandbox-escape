# Edge-sandbox-escape

This payload only works in x86 ... 

Alot of unoptimized and buggy code... would probably do things differently now. 

Hope this is of some use to someone.

I also did some weird things in the injector code .. so you might want to use your own shellcode injector if you are rebuilding my PoC ... and don't forget to readjust the deltas in my crappy asm.

Also this uses some scripts made by other people for shellcode generation and whatnot ... so credits belong to them for that.
